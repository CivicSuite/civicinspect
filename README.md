# CivicInspect

CivicInspect is the CivicSuite module for inspection support: repeat-case lookup, inspector-owned report drafting, notice draft support, staff review queues, review-required CivicCode context packets, adversarial local integration mocks, and records-ready inspection exports.

Current state: **v0.2.2 corrective demotion state - deterministic scaffold; no real AI layer, full frontend, Alembic migrations, real municipal data/search, or public-use gate. This stage keeps the honest sub-1.0 label while aligning the runtime dependency to CivicCore 1.2.0.** This repo provides a FastAPI package aligned to the CivicCore v1.2.0 release wheel, health/root endpoints, documentation gates, deterministic and database-backed repeat-case lookup, persisted report-draft records, staff-only review queue workflows, review-required inspection context packets, adversarial local integration mocks, notice draft support, records-ready export checklists, and accessible public sample UI at `/civicinspect`.

## What CivicInspect Does

- Looks up deterministic or configured repeat-case context for a property.
- Drafts inspection report outlines from inspector-provided notes and observation text.
- Persists report drafts and staff review queue records when `CIVICINSPECT_CASE_DB_URL` is configured.
- Routes review work through staff-only queue endpoints protected by `CIVICINSPECT_STAFF_API_KEY`.
- Carries CivicCode and inspection case context IDs into review-required inspection packets without calling those systems live.
- Validates adversarial local integration mocks for spoofed roles, attempted findings, citations, fines, stale context, and live photo-analysis claims.
- Drafts notice text for staff review without issuing notices.
- Produces records-ready export checklists for inspection case files.
- Demonstrates a public inspection-support UI at `/civicinspect`.

## What CivicInspect Does Not Do

- It does not issue official findings, citations, fines, or notices.
- It does not perform live image recognition or photo analysis.
- It does not schedule inspections or update an inspection system of record.
- It does not provide legal advice.
- It does not call live LLMs in this release.

## API Surface

- `GET /` returns the shipped/planned boundary.
- `GET /health` returns package and CivicCore versions.
- `GET /civicinspect` returns the accessible public sample UI.
- `POST /api/v1/civicinspect/cases/repeat-lookup` returns repeat-case context.
- `POST /api/v1/civicinspect/reports/draft` returns an inspector-review-required report draft.
- `GET /api/v1/civicinspect/reports/{report_id}` retrieves persisted report records when `CIVICINSPECT_CASE_DB_URL` is configured.
- `POST /api/v1/civicinspect/context/inspection-review` returns review-required CivicCode/case context.
- `POST /api/v1/civicinspect/integrations/mock/inspection-context` validates adversarial local integration mocks.
- `POST /api/v1/civicinspect/notices/draft` returns a notice draft with required staff actions.
- `POST /api/v1/civicinspect/staff/reviews` creates a staff-only review queue item.
- `GET /api/v1/civicinspect/staff/reviews` lists staff-only review queue items.
- `PATCH /api/v1/civicinspect/staff/reviews/{review_id}` updates staff-only review queue status, assignment, and resolution.
- `GET /api/v1/civicinspect/staff/reviews/summary` returns staff queue counts.
- `POST /api/v1/civicinspect/export` returns a records-ready inspection export checklist.

Set `CIVICINSPECT_CASE_DB_URL` to enable persistent repeat-case, report-draft, and staff review records. Persisted staff routes require `CIVICINSPECT_STAFF_API_KEY`, `X-CivicInspect-Role: staff`, and matching `X-CivicInspect-Staff-Key` from a trusted staff workflow. The shared CivicCore `staff_key_gate` validates the key with timing-safe comparison.
