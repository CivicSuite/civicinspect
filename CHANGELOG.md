# Changelog

All notable changes to CivicInspect will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Aligned the current CivicInspect runtime dependency and current-facing docs to the published CivicCore v1.2.0 release wheel.
- Wired the public `/civicinspect` draft workflow to the local report-draft API and safe DOM rendering.
- Added bounded API request validation with actionable 422 responses.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-23

- Narrow truth-repair release. No functional upgrade.
- Exists solely to supersede the false v1.0.0 release from 2026-05-21 in
  GitHub's Latest impression.
- CivicCore pin unchanged.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-21

### Corrected

- Corrected the false v1.0.0 release label after the independent CivicSuite release-integrity audit found CivicInspect does not meet the Section 2 FINISHED and SHIPPING bar.
- Set the honest current label to v0.2.1 and superseded the mistaken v1.0.0 posture without deleting the historical record.
- Current classification: deterministic scaffold; no real AI layer, full frontend, Alembic migrations, real municipal data/search, or public-use gate.
- CivicInspect must not be described as finished, shipping, city-ready, product-ready, or public-use ready until a future independent audit signs off against the full Section 2 gate.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- CivicInspect v1.0.0 public-use module release truth for inspection support.
- Current browser QA evidence for `/civicinspect`, `/docs/index.html`, loading, success, empty, error, and partial/degraded UI states.
- Agent Pipeline for Codex v0.9.0 policy scaffold for this release run.
- Current release plan evidence tied to the active CivicInspect scope lock.

### Changed

- Promoted package, runtime, docs, tests, and release verifier version truth from the demoted `0.2.0` recovery label to `1.0.0`.
- Kept the CivicCore v1.1.0 release-wheel dependency and shared timing-safe staff-key gate.
- Refreshed public UI copy, focus behavior, responsive layout, and actionable client-side state messages.

### Boundaries

- CivicInspect does not issue official findings, citations, fines, notices, inspection schedules, legal advice, live photo analysis, live LLM calls, or system-of-record updates.
- The earlier `v1.0.0` tag/release posture was superseded by `v0.2.0` recovery truth; this entry is the new active release pass and must be judged by the current run evidence.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Bumped CivicCore pin to v1.1.0 and used shared `staff_key_gate` for timing-safe staff review queue auth.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-10

- Demoted the false v1.0.0 release label after the external CivicSuite audit found this module was a recovery/foundation module, not a canonical spec-complete v1 product at that time.
- Preserved the useful recovery work while resetting the public package version to 0.2.0.
- Kept the CivicCore v1.0.0 wheel dependency and pinned it with SHA256 for release integrity.
- Superseded the prior public v1.0.0 posture; do not treat that historical tag as production-ready or spec-complete.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Aligned CivicInspect to `civiccore==0.3.0` while preserving the v0.1 inspection support foundation behavior.
- Updated release gates, CI wheel install, docs, tests, and browser-visible version copy for the v0.1.1 compatibility release.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- FastAPI package/runtime foundation pinned to `civiccore==0.2.0`.
- Repeat-case lookup helper using deterministic sample case data.
- Inspector-owned report draft helper.
- Notice draft helper with required staff-review actions.
- Records-ready inspection export checklist.
- Accessible public sample UI at `/civicinspect` with browser QA coverage.
- Release gate: tests, docs, placeholder import guard, Ruff, and build artifact checks.

### Not Shipped

- Official findings, citations, fines, notices, inspection scheduling, legal advice, live photo analysis, live LLM calls, and system-of-record integrations.
